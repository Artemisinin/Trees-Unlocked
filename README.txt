This mod is for Minecraft 1.17 (snapshot 21w08b) and requires Fabric loader and Fabric API 0.31.1+1.17 in the mod directory.  Fabric can be downloaded at https://fabricmc.net/.

This is a very simple mod that introduces a modified version of the tree feature that takes the normal tree configuration, but can be placed on almost every type of block. Allowable blocks are listed in a block tag, valid_ground_blocks.json, which can be edited to control what blocks the modified feature is placed on.

To demonstrate the tree, this mod includes an overworld with trees added to the seafloor and a cave dimension with cave trees added (I recommend visiting in creative, it is very dark and dangerous!). The cave tree configured features are defined in json so those interested in using datapacks can see how the feature is referenced.

If you use this tree feature in your mod or datapack, an acknowledgment and link back to this mod would be appreciated.
